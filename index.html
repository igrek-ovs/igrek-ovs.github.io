        <h2>Fishing with lodka, or cheater fishing</h2>
        <p>This kind is for really hard-working persons. To catch huge fish you must to deal with a cuple of problems. Firstable you should to inflate the boat. Then you will be fishing on the boat under the 
          scorching sun. I can say that there isa great minus: you cannot drink to much when you fishing on the boat</p>

        <h3>Here is the article from the wiki about this kind!</h3>
        <p>Wooden or metal boats are great for catching fish in stagnant waters. In addition, in windy weather, boats made of metal or wood stay on the water much more stable than inflatable boats. Even such boats can be equipped with a motor, so swimming in a pond on such vessels gives only pleasure and pleasant emotions to fishermen. In frame boats, which are large and designed for jig, it is very convenient to fish in a sitting and still standing position. This is very convenient, since in this case the control over the wiring is higher, and the fishing sector in this case is much larger.</p>
